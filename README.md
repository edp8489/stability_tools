# Stability Tools

This repository contains various resources related to analyzing the buckling behavior of structural elements:
- Digitized coefficient curves for flat plates of various boundary conditions and loading (ref NACA-TN-3781 thru -3786, Handbook of Structural Stability vols I-VI)
- Python implementations of methods described in Timoshenko, *Theory of Elastic Stability*
- (Maybe, eventually...) GUI tool that pulls everything together
